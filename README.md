Professor Hyongjun Choi from the Laboratory of Information Science In Sports at Dankook University has released LISIS Data Collector (LDC) v1.0.5, a data collection program he developed. This software has been designed to help those interested in Performance Analysis of Sport easily understand the theoretical principles behind it.

LDC enables users to customise the four essential elements of sports performance analysis—Player Information, Action Information, Position Information, and Time Information—to suit their needs. Additionally, users can add or remove elements as required for actual analysis.
